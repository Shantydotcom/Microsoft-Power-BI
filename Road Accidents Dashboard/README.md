# Road Accidents Analysis Dashboard

[![Road Accident Analysis](https://github.com/Shantydotcom/Microsoft-Power-BI-Projects/blob/main/Road%20Accidents%20Dashboard/Road%20Accident%20Analysis.png)

This project is a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. It provides actionable insights into accident trends, hotspots, and key contributing factors such as road conditions, weather, and light conditions. The dashboard can be used by stakeholders like government agencies, urban planners, and public safety officials to make data-driven decisions to improve road safety.

## Dashboard Features

### 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- **Total Casualties and Total Accidents**: Current year and year-on-year (YoY) growth.
- **Total Casualties by Accident Severity**: Breakdown of casualties into fatal, serious, and slight categories. Current year and year-on-year (YoY) growth.
- **Total Casualties by Vehicle Type**: Current year
- **Casualties monthly trends**: Current year and previous year
- **Casualties by Road Type**: Current year
- **Casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night**: Current year
- **Total Casualties and Total Accidents**: By location

### 2. Visual Insights:
- **Monthly Trend Analysis**: Comparison of current and previous years' casualties.
- **Categorical Analysis**:
  - Casualties by urban vs. rural areas.
  - Casualties by weather conditions (daylight vs. night).
  - Casualties by Vehicle type 
- **Road Type Analysis**: Accidents by single-lane, dual carriageway, and other road types.
- **Geographic Visualization**: Accident hotspots visualized on an interactive map.

### 3. Interactivity:
- **Slicers**: Filter by Weather Conditions and Road Surface.
- **Clickable Charts**: Enable detailed filtering across visuals.

### 4. Tools and Technologies:
- **Power BI Desktop**: For data visualization and reporting.
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning and transformation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating measures and KPIs.
- **Excel**: Used as the source of raw data.

### 5. Key Insights:

- **Urban Areas Have More Accidents**:  
  Casualties are significantly higher in urban areas, suggesting a need for improved traffic management in cities.

- **Single-Lane Roads are High-Risk**:  
  Most accidents occur on single-lane roads, indicating a need for infrastructure upgrades.

- **Daylight Accidents are More Frequent**:  
  Most accidents occur during daylight hours, possibly due to higher traffic volumes.

### 6. Dataset:

The dataset includes road accident records with fields like:
- Accident severity (fatal, serious, slight)
- Weather conditions
- Road surface type
- Location (latitude, longitude)
- Casualties and vehicles involved

## How to Use

### 1. Download the Project File:
- Clone the repository or download the `Road_Accidents_Dashboard.pbix` file.

### 2. Open in Power BI Desktop:
- Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed.
- Open the `.pbix` file in the software.

### 3. Explore the Dashboard:
- Use the slicers, charts, and maps to interact with the data.
  - Example: Filter by weather or road surface using the slicers.
  - Click on a map region to see its specific accident details.

### 4. Customize (Optional):
- Modify the dataset or visuals to your liking.
